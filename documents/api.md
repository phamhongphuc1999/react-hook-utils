#### 1. [useDeepEffect](../lib/use-deep-effect.ts)

- This hook acts like `useEffect` with a significant difference. useDeepEffect can detect exactly what and how dependencies change, give developer more information to create suitable effectCallback for every situations.

#### 2. [useExplorerUrl](../lib/use-explorer-url.ts)

- I have worked as a `blockchain developer` for a while. Sometimes, in the coding process, i must link a `transaction hash` or an `address` to its `blockchain explorer scan` such as [BSC Scan](https://bscscan.com/), [ETH Scan](https://etherscan.io/). This hook helps developers just build the right link.

#### 4. [useMousePosition](../lib/use-mouse-position.ts)

- This useful hook help for returning mouse position.

#### 4. [usePagination](../lib/use-pagination.ts)

- Obviously, usePagination is the very helpful hook when developer must work with tables, lists that require pagination service.

#### 5. [useScrollPosition](../lib/use-scroll-position.ts)

- Return scroll position and its status(you are scrolling up or down).

#### 6. [useTimeout](../lib/use-timeout.ts)

- This hook is very straightforward. It bears no difference to the regular setTimeout method from vanilla Javascript. But this custom hook simplifies its usage, and most importantly – lets you forget about clearing the interval when you’re done using it.
